                I am now accepting new beginner piano students. I have been studying piano under various teachers over the course of six years. In teaching your child I plan to give them a good foundation in the playing of piano. This foundation is very helpful when learning other instruments. So whether your child wants to become a master at the piano or some other instrument this is an excellent place to start!
